## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

As a huge fan of basketball (especially about the NBA), I always wanted to investigate into the statistics of the league to showcase trends or even to answer specific questions.
1. The 3-Pointer has become fundamental.
2. Did Stephen Curry revolutionize Basketball?
3. Is Michael Jordan the GOAT (Greatest Of AllÂ Time)?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Here is the data used for analysis and a notebook to showcase work related to the above questions. Steps of the analysis are described within the notebook.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@adlef01/the-nba-under-data-analysis-4e2e726038b0).
